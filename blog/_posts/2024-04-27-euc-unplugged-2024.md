## Intro

For the first time, I was able to attend the EUC Unplugged event with my colleague Craig Stones from Teba. EUC Unplugged, for those who have never been, is a vendor agnostic EUC community event with the whoâ€™s who in attendance. The event follows an un-conference format. Basically, thereâ€™s no agenda before the event starts and the aim to get people at the event to run sessions based on what attendees want to discuss or learn about â€“ basically the good stuff that normally gets covered between presentations at a normal conference

Below is an overview of the event for me, and if youâ€™d like to learn more about this event, check out the link [here](https://www.thinclient.net/blog/euc-unplugged-2024-is-here).

## Getting There

After a long flight from Perth via Singapore, Tokyo and LA, I landed in Phoenix for EUC Unplugged  

As I mentioned on my LinkedIn post, there has been so many changes in the EUC landscape and hybrid cloud over the last couple of years, so I was eagerly looking forward to learning and sharing with the industry's best at EUC Unplugged.  

This will be my first time attending EUC Unplugged and is my first time to Phoenix. I look forward to sharing my thoughts with the group and bringing the outcomes of the conference back to our customers.

## Event Overview

The event itself is over a 3-day period and I had a little bit of time to settle in adjust to the timezone and explore the area both before things kicked off and after the event. The event hotel was a great choice and a nice place to relax between sessions each day.

I had the chance to meet a lot of people Iâ€™d only interacted with via video, forums or LinkedIn previously which was fantastic. The event has such a great community atmosphere and mixes sessions with an opportunity to network, do fun activities and learn.

After the welcome and kick-off, the attendees work together to outline key topics theyâ€™d like to discuss at the conference and/or potentially present on. After this, the group votes on what the agenda will be. I was lucky enough to get to host the last session of the conference before it closed out. In my session, we had a full room of people discussing the impact of industry consolidation. I had a fantastic volunteer panel of [DJ ðŸŽ™ Eshelman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/djeshelman/), [Leee Jeffries](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leee-jeffries-0021752a/), [Ryan Costello](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rycostello/) and [Jan Tytgat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jantytgat/). There was some fantastic passionate discussion and unity in the way the community is working together through a time of a lot of change.

Many people have given great overviews and reviews which you can find on LinkedIn. Iâ€™d highly recommend taking a look at [Jaymes Davis' Linkedin Post - Reflecting on EUC Unplugged: Insights and Takeaways](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reflecting-euc-unplugged-insights-takeaways-jaymes-davis-k2h3c/) as this sums things up nicely.

## Post Event and Other Activities

Whilst I was in Phoenix, I had the opportunity to head into town and do a day long food tour which was a fantastic way to learn about some of the history along with a chance to sample some great food. I also went on a number of runs to explore the countryside and took a group hike/run with some of the attendees up Camelback Mountain with friends and colleagues [Jim Moyle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimmoyle/) [Blair Parkhill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blairp/) [Alan Hodson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-hodson-gaicd-8378a23/) Jack Madden Eric Ormond.

After the conference, before flying out with the long return to Perth, I had the opportunity to tick off a bucket list item and visit the Grand Canyon which was truly spectacular as you can see from the photo below.

## Wrap-Up

If you get the chance to attend EUC Unplugged, Iâ€™d highly recommend it for anyone in the EUC field. I'll definitely be aiming to be back next year and staying in touch with the many people I met.
