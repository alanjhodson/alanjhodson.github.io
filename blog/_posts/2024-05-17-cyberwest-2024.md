## Overview

I recently spent a great couple of days at the [CyberWest Summit](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cyberwestsummit/) 2024 event. There was a fantastic turnout and many topical sessions covered from Governance to Defence. The sessions delved deep into the cutting-edge of cyber resilience over two action-packed days.

It was also great to see a mix of vendor presentations and guest speakers including a discussion on Finance and Cyber with [Scott Pape](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottpape/), The Barefoot Investor himself who gave his insights on safeguarding financial assets in our digital world.

It was a great event and I’ll definitely be aiming to attend again in 2025 and if there’s an opportunity I’d like to speak at the event next year.
