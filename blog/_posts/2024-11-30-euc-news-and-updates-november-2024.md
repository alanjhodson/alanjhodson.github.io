# EUC News and Updates November 2024

Here’s a roundup of News and Updates from November 2024.

## EUC News

The following are some of the key news items in EUC for the month of November 2024:

### Microsoft

**Microsoft Ignite 2024**

Microsoft Ignite 2024 is a four-day hybrid event that took place between November 18–22, 2024, in Chicago at the McCormick Place West, as well as online. The event covered new technology and capability, with an overarching theme of expanding generative AI’s summarisation and rewriting capabilities.

There’s so much to cover off from the event. The "Azure Update - IGNITE 2024 SPECIAL" [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwnAd_UE8n4) by [**John Savill**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-savill/) provides a comprehensive overview of the latest Microsoft developments announced during the conference. This includes various updates and enhancements such as Azure Local (Azure Stack HCI), new Azure VM SKUs, CoPilot, Windows 365 Link, Server 2025 and more. As always, if you’re looking for a more detailed breakdown of all Ignite announcements, check out Microsoft's official [**Book of News**](https://news.microsoft.com/ignite-2024-book-of-news/) for Ignite 2024.

During the event Microsoft announced Windows 365 Link, which is a thin client device, dedicated to Windows 365. The focus of this device being for Windows 365 rather than Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) is to be noted, as Windows 365 emphasizes a Cloud PC approach that is simple, personal, and predictable—a "desktop in the cloud" experience. At the same time, Citrix also announced changes to their SKUs to support Windows 365 customers.

### Work of EUC

**EUC World Independence 2024 Keynote**

Unfortunately I wasn’t able to get there in person this year, but during the keynote, [**Gabe Knuth**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabeknuth/), [**Shawn Bass**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawnbass/) and [**Brian Madden**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bmadden/)  discussed the state and developments around EUC. Some of the key takeaways they discussed were:  

- **Desktop Virtualization is Surging:** While SaaS dominates, desktop virtualization (VDI/DaaS) is set to grow sevenfold, bridging legacy Windows apps and modern SaaS tools.
- **VDI/DaaS Enhances Security Resilience:** Recent incidents, like the CrowdStrike outage, highlight how VDI/DaaS ensures faster recovery and business continuity against ransomware and other threats.
- **Windows Apps Remain Essential:** Despite the shift to SaaS, most organizations still depend on Windows apps, solidifying the role of desktop and app virtualization in IT strategies.
- **AI Drives EUC Innovation:** AI agents are streamlining routine tasks and enhancing productivity, often leveraging persistent virtual desktops to maintain operations even offline.
