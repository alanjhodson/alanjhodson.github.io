## Overview

I'm passionate about helping others and their organisations achieve their potential and aim to give back to the community where I can also. Below are some of the ways I do this. Please reach out to me if you feel I'd be a good fit for your organisation.

## Boards

I'm a member of the *[Australian Institute of Company Directors](https://www.aicd.com.au)* and I am always on the lookout for organisations that I align with who would benefit from a Board Member who can ensure that Innovation, Technology, ESG and business goals and requirements are aligned from the board level.

## Committee Work

Outside of IT related work I have several other hobbies and organisations I'm a part of. This includes the following current roles as well as general membership:

- President, *[Armadale City Concert Band](https://www.armadalecityconcertband.org.au)*
- Secretary,  *[Midland Cycle Club](https://www.midlandcycleclub.com.au)*

I'd especially like to call out the Armadale City Concert Band which I've been a member for over 20 years. It is a not for profit community organisation made up of people from all walks of life and all age groups. It is a part of Act, Belong, Commit and provides a great service to the local and surrounding regions. Being a not for profit it is also always looking out for sponsors so if you or your organisation are interested in supporting them, please reach out to me.

## Mentoring

I have always enjoyed mentoring and have been a trainer, coach, instructor and various other educational related roles in many organisations. This year I am lucky to be a part of the *[St Marys 2024 i3 Program](https://www.stmarys.wa.edu.au/senior-school/flagship-programs/)* and will act as a mentor.
