subtitle: Does your organisation need my assistance?
---

I am available to assist your organisation if you feel my skillset would be of benefit. This could be as simple as an informal discussion over coffee or something a bit more formal. I have my own Australian registered Pty Ltd business so can be engaged directly or am also happy to assist other systems integrators or businesses if you already have a working relationship with another business. 

Additionally, I'm happy to consult to integrators who need my assistance on a project or similar and as always am fully transparent and ethical in the way that I work. 

Whilst I'm based in Perth, Western Australia, I am also happy to work in different regions and timezones and can support multiple currencies, so for example if you're a US or UK based customer or partner feel free to reach out, I'm happy to travel where required also.

I'm always looking to find the right organisations I can assist and grow with also and this includes joining boards of both established and startup organisations.

I'm flexible on how to be engaged. This can include:

- Fixed Cost Projects
- Agreed Hourly Rates
- Discounted Pre-Paid Services
- Ongoing Services, a regular booking for specialist services on a 3, 6, 12 month (or longer) basis

If you would like to have a chat or discuss any of the topics I blog about, feel free to reach out and should you like to get in touch, you can email me at <mail@alanhodson.com> or use the provided [contact form](/contact).
