-   End User Computing (EUC) including, solutions from Amazon, Citrix, Microsoft, Nerdio and VMware

This could be as simple as an informal discussion over coffee or something a bit more formal. I have my own Australian registered Pty Ltd business so can be engaged directly or am also happy to assist other systems integrators or businesses if you already have a working relationship with another business. 

## Partnering

Partnering is an option that works for many orgainisations, especially larger ones. I'm happy to consult with integrators who need my assistance on a project or similar, and, am always fully transparent and ethical in the way that I conduct my work. I can also assist in reviewing an existing IT Services related business and act as a coach or third-party reviewer.

## International Work

Whilst I'm based in Perth, Western Australia, I am also happy to work in different regions and timezones and can support multiple currencies/ For example, if you're a US or UK based customer or partner, feel free to reach out as I'm happy to travel when and where required.

## Startup and Board Consulting

I'm always looking to find the right organisations I can assist and grow with. This includes joining boards of both established and startup organisations.

## How to Engage and Contact Me

I'm flexible on how to be engaged. This can include:

-   Fixed Cost Projects
-   Agreed Hourly Rates
-   Pre-Paid Services
-   Ongoing Services, or a regular booking for specialist services on a 3, 6, 12 month (or longer) basis
