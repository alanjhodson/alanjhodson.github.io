subtitle: Does your organisation need my assistance?
---

I am available to assist your organisation if you feel my skillset would be of benefit. This could be as simple as an informal discussion over coffee or something a bit more formal. I have my own Australian registered Pty Ltd business so can be engaged directly or am also happy to assist other systems integrators or businesses if you already have a working relationship with another business. 

Additionally, I'm happy to consult to integrators who need my assistance on a project or similar and as always am fully transparent and ethical in the way that I work. 

Whilst I'm based in Perth, Western Australia, I am also happy to work in different regions and timezones and can support multiple currencies, so for example if you're a US based customer or partner feel free to reach out, I'm happy to travel where required also.

If you would like to have a chat or discuss any of the topics I blog about, feel free to reach out.

If you would like to get in touch, you can email me at _mail_@_alanhodson_com_ or use the provided [contact form](/contact).
