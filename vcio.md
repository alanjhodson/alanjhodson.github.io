## Overview

The pace of change and complexity of technology in business today can be both overwhelming and potentially distracting for businesses. I have previously helped organisations from small business to large enterprise with their IT strategies, security assessments and, more broadly, aligning their business needs with technology as a trusted advisor. 

I've helped many CxO's, worked as an IT Manager, built and run a small to medium business and been through mergers and aquisitions of both private and listed entities, so my experience is of benefit to many organisations. Running a small or medium-sized business can be quite challenging. The current landscape around areas like Governance, Compliance, Security, AI, Cloud, Remote Working and more is very complex. However, many organisations simply can't justify a CIO (Chief Information Officer) or CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) based on their current size and costs. Finding a part time person can also be difficult. My vCIO service is designed to help your business reach its full potential at an affordable price. A vCIO is a third-party (e.g. a consultant or business) that offers a part-time person as a service to fulfill the role as a conventional CIO or IT Manager.

## What would I do as your vCIO?

A CIO serves as the most senior tech executive within a business. They are generally responsible for any strategic planning related to technology and may also work with or act as the CISO. Small and medium-sized businesses rarely have a CIO because they simply can’t afford to hire one. However, what small business owners can do is hire a virtual CIO to provide expert insight when it comes to their company’s IT plan.

What I can do as your vCIO will vary depending on your needs, but some of the services I can provide include:

- Developing IT strategies: I aim to work with you to understand your business objectives and goals and  will develop a technology strategy that will help you achieve them.

- Analysing IT infrastructure and investments: If you have an existing investment in IT infrastructure or cloud services I will aim to ensure that they are the best fit, that they're enabling the business to achieve its goals and that appropriate security, governance and risks are considered.

- Providing IT security services: I can work to ensure that security related training and enablement are in place for staff and that the business' maturity around policy are aligned with current requirements, such as those from the *[ASD](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight/essential-eight-explained)*.  

- Meet your Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Goals: I can assist in driving operational and cost efficiencies to help meet your sustainability goals.

- Developing a technology roadmap: I aim to be really familiar with your company and understand what your main goals are. This helps to ensure that I can develop an IT roadmap that gets reviewed each quarter and allows you to see which changes you can make to your tech stack to reach your business goals.

- Managing your technology budget: By using my virtual CIO services, you will get an excellent plan on the capital and consumption based technology investments you should be making for each staff member based on your budget. I can also ensure suppliers and partners are meeting their targets and providing the best price and services to your business.
